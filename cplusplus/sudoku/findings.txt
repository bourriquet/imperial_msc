This .txt file contains my answer to question 5 - summarising the difficulty identification process.

####################################################################################################################

The best way to categorise a Sudoku puzzle by its difficulty would be
according to the 'difficulty', or complexity, of the logic methods used to solve
it. However as my solve_board function does not make much use of
logic, only whether a move is valid or not, the difficulty of the
puzzle can not be identified this way. A move is considered to be
valid if it satisfies the Boolean make_move function.

Instead, I thought of the following ways the difficulty of the puzzle could be
identified:
- how many times the solve_board function was called (forwardly recursed)
- how many times the solve_board function removed a digit from the
board (backwardly recursed)
- how many total unique - only one 'true' make_move for a cell -  valid moves there were at the start (turned out to
be 0 in each puzzle)
- how many total valid moves there were at each call of the function
- how 'constrained' the puzzle is at the start

I computed both how many times the function backwardly recursed and
how constrained the puzzle was at the start to attempt to identify its
difficulty. How well constrained the puzzle was was a direct measure
of how many total 'valid moves' there were at the start of the puzzle.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The findings were as follows...

EASY
Constrained score: 190
Backwards recursion count: 2116

MEDIUM
Constrained score: 204
Backwards recursion count: 15605

mystery1
Constrained score: 227
Backwards recursion count: 421488

mystery2
Constrained score: 205
Backwards recursion count: 11532

mystery3
Constrained score: 222
Backwards recursion count: 14076

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although the backwards recursion score for the 'mystery3' puzzle is
lower than the medium puzzle, its constrained score is higher. Although the constrained
scores of the 'mystery1' and 'mystery3' puzzles are very similar, the backwards
recursion score for 'mystery1' is much higher. We already know that the
'mystery2' is unsolvable from question 4.

With this in mind, I would say that the 'mystery1' puzzle is the 'extremely hard'
rating and the 'mystery3' puzzle is the 'hard' rating.

However, a comparison of the logic methods used to solve the puzzle
would give a more accurate understanding of the difficulty of the puzzle.
